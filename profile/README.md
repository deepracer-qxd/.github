# Hi there 👋

```cpp
 Welcome to the DeepRacer QXD (Quixada - Ceara, Brazil) study group
```

As a group, we have meetings to discuss [AWS DeepRacer](https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/), the Autonomous Racing Car 🏎️ from Amazon Web Services that promotes **an easy and fast way to start your journey in Machine Learning**. 🤖 We discuss race strategies to prepare the students for national 🇧🇷 and international 🌐 competitions.
